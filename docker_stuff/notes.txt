# Remember that when building a docker image, each RUN command is becoming a writeable layer (container) and is first run, written to the image, and then destroyed. so try to chain RUNs when possible to reduce the number of image layers.

# Use --no-cache=true when you absolutely don't want the current build to base on previous builds
