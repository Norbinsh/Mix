# Remember that when building a docker image, each RUN command is becoming a writeable layer (container) and is first run, written to the image, and then destroyed. so try to chain RUNs when possible to reduce the number of image layers.

# Use --no-cache=true when you absolutely don't want the current build to base on previous builds

# We can use docker compose for more multi container automated setup, for example:

version: '2'
services:
  dockerapp: # from version 2 and above there's no need to link containers as we can just use their name
    build: . # Dockerfile sits here
    ports:
      - "5000:5000" # Expose 5000 on the container to 5000 on the host
    volumes:
      - .:/app # This is great, no need for manual COPY commands in the docker file if build correctly
  redis:
    image: redis:3.2.0
