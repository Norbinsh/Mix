Note to self.shay:

# Mini project, a page that will display a random quote from external data
# source. User can click a button to replace the quote.


# Freestyle
# Display a quote upon page load
# Clicking a button will change current quote
# Clicking a button will tweet out the current quote



1. Frontend

- Middle of the screen, set a place for the quote to be displayed with a nice
background, leave room for quote author above it
- Beneath the quote have 2 buttons, quote replace, quote tweet

Make sure each element can be referred to specifically for later use.

2. Backend

- Quotes should be retrieved from external data-source, Google said to use http://quotesondesign.com/wp-json/posts?filter[orderby]=rand&filter[posts_per_page]=1
- Listen to Google (;)
- Quote should auto refresh every 60 second from the last refresh (button) or page load time
- On page load should set initial quote without requiring any user action
- Get JSON once, then push it into the right elements (author && quote HTML tags)
- Work on the buttons: update quote, twitt quote

Have Fun!
